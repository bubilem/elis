    <h2>Idea</h2>
    <p>
      JID, the conjointed project of schools from the Czech Republic and Poland, was formed by
      a&nbsp;firm named Erasmus. Our school was chosen from many other contestants. We are
      a&nbsp;class of 14&nbsp;people and our work on the project is the IT part, as you can see on
      this site that we made. The Polish students have the logistics skills that are needed for this
      project aswell.

    <h2>Our goal</h2>
    <p>
      The main objective is an exchange of methodology and good practices in the field of logistics
      and information technology. The project aims to raise awareness of ways and specific
      requirements of road and water transport and to deepen the knowledge of the partnersâ€™ cultures
      at the same time. The choice of the project goal is related to the regional specifics.
      A&nbsp;subsequent objective is to embed gained experience, outcomes and examples of good
      practice into the education process. Knowledge and skills will be passed on in the form of
      peer-to-peer learning among students and teachers, as well.
