<!-- CZ Visit - Trip to Prague -->
<p>
  During wednesday we've gone to Prague. The ride there was a bit longer due to a traffic jam but
  we've made it in one piece. We have visited Petřín Lookout Tower, St. Vitus Cathedral, Prague
  Castle and Golden Lane. When we were in Prague we have also visited shopping center PALLADIUM
  Prague. After coming back from the trip we've had another workshop from the polish group.
