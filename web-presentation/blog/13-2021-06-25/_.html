<!--CZ-Visit Saying our goodbyes and way home -->
<p>
  On Friday the 25th of June we had our last day with the polish friends. Right after we had our
  breakfast we met for the last time. We exchanged our opinions about the whole week, how we enjoyed
  ourselves, what we liked and what we disliked. We told each other whats left and what we need to
  perfect. Lastly we told our goodbyes and the polish friends went on their way home.
