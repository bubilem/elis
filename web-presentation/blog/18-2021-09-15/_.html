<!-- PL Visit - Trip to Sweden -->
<p>
  Today was the most eventfull out of all the days, since we arrived in
  Karlskrona, Sweden. The sunset from the boat was very pretty so we went to
  take some pictures and then unloaded off the ship. The ship was a big freight
  ship, as you can see on the picture. After unloading, we got onto our bus and
  made a few stops around the city, taking pictures wherever we could. We also
  visited a naval museum full of swedish naval history. After Karlskrona came
  Kalmar, which was comprised of both historic and modern structures. We visited
  a local castle, used for the signing of a pact of scandinavian countries in
  the 15th century. There was also the castle town, made out of very small and
  brightly colored houses. It even had its own dwarf settlement! After
  sightseeing came shopping. The day ended by us getting onto another freight
  ship and sailing home.
