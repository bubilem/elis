<!-- CZ  Visit- Tuesday -->
<p>
  In the morning at 9:00 went on our way to logistics firm NOPROSU, where they showed us everything
  about logistics and truck transport, which was very interesting and educative. At 10:30 we went to
  the local beer brewery named Kocour, where we had an interesting excursion full of new information
  about beer making and stuff and we even had a little taste of their strongest beer, which by the
  way is the 2nd strongest beer in Europe. At 14:00 the polish classmates had their own workshop
  about logistics and their home city Ostroda, where we learnt about what they are studying and the
  basic principles of logistics. At 15:30 the czech classmates had their own workshop about IT and
  Czech Republic, where the polish people learnt about IT systems, how to fill them with data and
  their principles.
