  On our third meeting, we discussed the functionality of our database and reviewed it with our
  polish co-workers. First, we designed a database that was too complicated, containing many tables
  and relationships. After debate and analysis, we found that a lot of data in the system has
  remained unchanged for a long time, so we chose the path of code lists using JSON files.

<h2>Tables (RMD)</h2>
<p>main: user, route, event, vehicle, place, package, package_log</p>
<p>rel: user_has_role, route_has_user</p>
<h2>Code lists (JSON)</h2>
<p>countries, event-types, languages, package-states, package-types, user-roles</p>

    >All code list JSON files.</a
