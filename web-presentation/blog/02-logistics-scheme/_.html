  We had worked on the principles of logistics together with students from both schools. We took
  into account places, packages, routes, events, etc. We simulated the path of one package and
  determined the various states (receiving, handing over, waiting...) that can occur with
  a&nbsp;package. We also solved the creation of routes, which gradually have many states (loading,
  waiting, on way, refueling, resting...) in&nbsp;different places. The result was our logistics
  scheme.

  This scheme is very important for us to design the database and architecture of the entire web
  application.
