  In order to create a website and other promotional materials, we designed a project logo. First we
  tried different fonts and finally we chose Oswald from Google fonts. Our goal was to design a very
  simple logo in curves that can be easily used on various platforms. We used the Inkscape
  application to implement the logo.
