<!-- Intro = Arrival of the czech group to Ostróda and more info about the day. -->
<p>
  The first day of our visit started with us arriving to Ostróda and having a
  workshop in a local hotel conference room prepared for us by the polish team.
  That was later followed by us hanging out for some time and spending the night
  in the very same hotel.
