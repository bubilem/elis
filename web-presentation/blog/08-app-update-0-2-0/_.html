<h2>Dispatcher section</h2>
<p>
  Routes can now be closed. However, this is only allowed if they no longer contain any packages.
  The route listing table has changed. The dispatcher now sees the date and type of the last event.
  Closed routes are displayed differently and are located at the end of the list below the active
  ones. When creating a new route, the logged-in user automatically becomes its dispatcher. He
  cannot remove himself from the route.

<p>
  It is now possible to add events in the event list for the route. A new event INS (instructions)
  has been added. If a route is closed, we cannot add more events to it.

  Packages have a clearer table. Their journey can now be ended. In addition to the final FRW
  (forwarded) and DST (destroyed) states, a new CNC (canceled) state has been added. If the package
  is in a route, we can easily get to the route log.

<h2>Driver section</h2>
<p>
  The changes in the driver section are similar to the changes in event management in the dispatcher
  section.
