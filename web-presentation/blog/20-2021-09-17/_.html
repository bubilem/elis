<!--PL Visit- Saying our goodbyes and way home 
    PL Visit- Friday-->
<p>
  On Friday the 17th we had our last day with the polish group. Right after we
  had our breakfast we met for the last time. We talk about our opinions about
  the whole week, what we liked and what we disliked. We told each other whats
  left and what we need to perfect. Lastly we told our goodbyes and went on our
  way home. We departed around 8am, during the journey we had to make a few
  stops, so we arrived in the Czech republic around 5pm.
