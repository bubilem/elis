<!--Logistical dictionary
We have created logistical dictionary-->
<p>
  Together we have created a logistical dictionary. We translated the words into
  3 langages, starting with polish, then czech and lastly into english. We tried
  to focus only on the important words from lofistics, which are commonly used.
  We learnt a lot of new words during this process. Over all there are 60 words,
  so we think that it has more than enough to use and choose from.
