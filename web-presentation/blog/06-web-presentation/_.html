  We create a web presentation so that we can present the project and document it on an ongoing
  basis. It was important for us that the website was modern, responsive, clear and simple. First we
  had to create a website design. We designed the wireframe and basic design in Adobe XD. The
  website will contain four basic sections (Home, ELIS, Blog and Contacts).
</p>
<p>
  We divided the work in the team (design, coding, styles, content, SEO, responsiveness,
  programming, hosting, social, security ...) and gradually we put the website together.
</p>
<p>
  We use standard front-end technologies HTML, SCSS for web operation. The website is generated on
  the server by our own simple program in PHP.
