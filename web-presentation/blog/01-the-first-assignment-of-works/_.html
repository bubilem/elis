  We started talking about working on the project "The journey is the destination" on the 13th of
  November. Everyone was in a positive mood and work topics were given to everybody without a
  problem. Since then, we have been working and still are on our individual parts in teams, which we
  check and adjust with the help of our teacher, Ing. Michal Bub√≠lek, on pre-arranged meetings. He
  gives us interesting and educational comments and remarks to properly adjust and refine our work.
  Teamwork is crucial in this project, so we have embraced it to the utmost degree.
